# Logistic Regression on Diabetes Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression to predict diabetes using a public dataset. The workflow is provided in a Jupyter notebook: [Logistic_Regression_Diabetes_DataSet.ipynb]
Logistic Regression is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. In this project, we use it to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which includes features such as:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

The target variable is whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).
